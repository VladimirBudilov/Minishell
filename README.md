# Minishell Project

Welcome to the Minishell project, a collaborative effort undertaken by two students at 42 School. In this project, we've set out to create our own shell, inspired by the likes of Bash but with a focus on simplicity and learning.

## Project Overview

**Minishell** is an educational endeavor that allows us to delve deep into the world of system processes, file descriptors, and command execution. Building our shell is a significant milestone in our journey as programmers, and we're excited to share our progress with you.

## Key Features

While Minishell may not have all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged shell like Bash, it does offer several key features, including:

- **Command Execution**: Minishell can execute simple shell commands, allowing us to interact with the system.

- **Built-in Commands**: We've implemented some basic built-in commands to navigate directories and manipulate the environment.

- **Piping and Redirection**: Minishell supports basic piping and redirection of input and output, making it a versatile tool.

## How You Can Help

Since this is an ongoing learning experience, we welcome any feedback or bug reports you may have. If you come across any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to share them with us. Your input is valuable as we continue to refine and enhance Minishell.

## Collaboration and Learning

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are at the heart of the 42 School experience. By working on this project, we're not only enhancing our own skills but also contributing to the broader programming community. We hope that you find Minishell interesting and informative, whether you're a fellow student or a curious programmer.

Thank you for checking out our Minishell project. We look forward to your feedback and to sharing more about our programming journey with you.

Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
